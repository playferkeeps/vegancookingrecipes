# Social Media Engagement Optimization

## Overview

The social media posting scripts have been enhanced to maximize engagement through strategic caption optimization, engagement hooks, and better hashtag strategies.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Engagement Questions**

Each post now includes a randomly selected engagement question to encourage comments:

- "Who's making this tonight? 👇"
- "Save this for later! 📌"
- "Tag someone who needs to try this! 👥"
- "What's your favorite vegan recipe? Let me know below! 💬"
- "Have you tried this before? Share your experience! ✨"
- And more variations...

### 2. **Recipe-Specific Hooks**

Dynamic hooks based on recipe type:

- **Desserts**: "Perfect for satisfying that sweet tooth! 🍰"
- **Soups/Stews**: "Comfort food at its finest! Perfect for cozy nights. 🍲"
- **Salads**: "Fresh, healthy, and absolutely delicious! 🥗"
- **Pasta**: "The ultimate comfort food, vegan style! 🍝"
- **Breakfast**: "Start your day right with this! ☀️"
- **Easy/Quick**: "Quick, easy, and absolutely delicious! Perfect for busy weeknights. ⚡"

### 3. **Enhanced Hashtag Strategy**

- **Base hashtags**: Core vegan/plant-based terms
- **Category hashtags**: Recipe-specific (e.g., #VeganBaking, #VeganSavory)
- **Engagement hashtags**: Community-focused (#VeganCommunity, #VeganFoodie)
- **Niche hashtags**: Targeted discovery (#VeganFoodShare, #VeganCookingTips)

### 4. **Varied Call-to-Actions**

Multiple CTA variations to avoid repetition:

- "👉 Full recipe in bio link!"
- "👉 Get the full recipe:"
- "👉 Recipe link in bio!"
- "👉 Full recipe below!"

### 5. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**

#### Instagram

- Multiple engagement questions
- Strategic hashtag placement (10-12 hashtags)
- Emoji variety for visual appeal
