    ingredientNotes: '**Vegan Butter**: Use a high-quality vegan butter like Earth Balance or Miyoko\'s for best results. You can substitute coconut oil, but it will change the texture and flavor. For oil-free options, try applesauce or mashed banana, though the texture will be different. **Brown Sugar**: Light brown sugar works best for that classic cookie flavor. You can substitute with coconut sugar or reduce the amount if you prefer less sweetness. Granulated sugar can work in a pinch, but brown sugar gives better texture. **Plant-Based Milk**: Any unsweetened plant milk works - almond, soy, oat, or cashew milk all work great. Use just enough to bring the dough together. **Vegan Chocolate Chips**: Check labels carefully - many chocolate chips contain dairy. Enjoy Life, Trader Joe\'s semi-sweet chips, and Guittard are reliably vegan. You can also chop up a vegan chocolate bar for chunkier cookies. **Flour**: All-purpose flour works best. For gluten-free, use a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend like Bob\'s Red Mill or King Arthur. Don\'t use almond flour as a direct substitute.',
    faqs: [
      { question: 'Do I need to chill the cookie dough?', answer: 'No, this vegan chocolate chip cookie recipe doesn\'t require chilling. The dough can be baked immediately after mixing. However, if you prefer thicker cookies, you can chill the dough for 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking.' },
      { question: 'Why are my cookies spreading too much?', answer: 'If your cookies are spreading too much, the vegan butter might be too soft or melted. Make sure it\'s softened but still cool to the touch. You can also add 1-2 tablespoons more flour to the dough. Over-mixing can also cause spreading, so mix just until combined.' },
      { question: 'Can I make these cookies gluten-free?', answer: 'Yes! Substitute the all-purpose flour with a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend. I recommend Bob\'s Red Mill, King Arthur, or Better Batter gluten-free flour. The cookies will have a slightly different texture but will still be delicious.' },
      { question: 'How long do these vegan cookies stay fresh?', answer: 'These cookies will stay fresh for 3-4 days when stored in an airtight container at room temperature. They also freeze beautifully - either freeze the baked cookies or freeze the cookie dough balls for fresh-baked cookies anytime.' },
      { question: 'Can I use coconut oil instead of vegan butter?', answer: 'Yes, but it will change the texture and flavor. Coconut oil tends to make cookies crispier and adds a slight coconut flavor. For best results, use solid coconut oil (not melted) and expect a different texture than with vegan butter.' },
      { question: 'Are all chocolate chips vegan?', answer: 'No, many chocolate chips contain dairy products like milk fat or butter oil. Always check the ingredients list. Enjoy Life brand is always vegan, as are Trader Joe\'s semi-sweet chips and many store brands. When in doubt, check for dairy ingredients on the label.' },
    ],
    tips: [
      'Don\'t over-bake! The cookies should look slightly underdone when you take them out - they\'ll continue cooking on the hot pan and firm up as they cool. This ensures a soft, chewy texture.',
      'Use room temperature vegan butter for best results. If it\'s too cold, the cookies won\'t spread properly. If it\'s too warm, they\'ll spread too much.',
      'For perfectly round cookies, use a cookie scoop to portion the dough, then roll into smooth balls with your hands.',
      'Line your baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup and to prevent sticking.',
      'Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack - this helps them set properly.',
      'If your dough seems too wet, add 1-2 tablespoons of flour. If it\'s too dry, add a tablespoon of plant-based milk.',
    ],
    variations: [
      'Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans for nutty chocolate chip cookies.',
      'Mix in 1/2 cup dried cranberries or raisins for a fruity twist.',
      'Use white chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate for a different flavor profile.',
      'Add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of oats for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.',
      'Sprinkle coarse sea salt on top before baking for salted chocolate chip cookies.',
      'Make double chocolate chip cookies by adding 1/4 cup cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.',
    ],
    storage: 'Store these vegan chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-4 days. For longer storage, freeze the baked cookies in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. You can also freeze the cookie dough balls on a baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag. When ready to bake, simply place frozen dough balls on a baking sheet and add 1-2 minutes to the baking time - no need to thaw!',

    ingredientNotes: '**Rice Noodles**: Use flat rice noodles (pad thai noodles) for authentic texture. You can find them in the Asian section of most grocery stores. If unavailable, linguine works in a pinch. **Tofu**: Extra-firm tofu works best. Press it well to remove excess water for better browning. You can substitute with tempeh or add more vegetables if preferred. **Tamarind Paste**: This is essential for authentic Pad Thai flavor. Find it in Asian markets or online. If unavailable, you can substitute with lime juice and a bit of brown sugar, though the flavor won\'t be quite the same. **Soy Sauce**: Use regular soy sauce or tamari for gluten-free. You can also use coconut aminos for a soy-free option. **Vegetables**: Feel free to customize with your favorite vegetables - bell peppers, snap peas, or bok choy all work great.',
    faqs: [
      { question: 'Can I make this Pad Thai without tamarind paste?', answer: 'While tamarind paste gives authentic Pad Thai its signature tangy flavor, you can substitute it with 2 tablespoons of lime juice mixed with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. The flavor will be slightly different but still delicious.' },
      { question: 'How do I prevent the noodles from sticking together?', answer: 'Make sure to cook the rice noodles according to package directions and rinse them with cold water after cooking. Have all your ingredients prepped and ready before you start cooking, as Pad Thai comes together quickly.' },
      { question: 'Can I make this recipe gluten-free?', answer: 'Yes! Use tamari instead of soy sauce, and make sure your rice noodles are gluten-free (most are naturally gluten-free). Check all sauce labels to ensure they\'re gluten-free.' },
      { question: 'What can I substitute for tofu?', answer: 'You can use tempeh, seitan, or simply add more vegetables like bell peppers, snap peas, or mushrooms. The recipe is very flexible with protein options.' },
      { question: 'How do I store leftover Pad Thai?', answer: 'Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a wok or large pan with a splash of water or vegetable broth to prevent sticking.' },
